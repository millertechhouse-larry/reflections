How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I could quickly see the differences in each file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    See what changes were made in the past, look to see which ones were impactful

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro - control, have the opportunity for the right number of commits
	Con - can forget to do it, different people might have different opinions about
	the right size for the commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In coding, several files may change to implement a single feature.  This is
	usually not necessary for unrelated documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    use git log to find the change that I want, use git diff to compare that with
	the previous revision to see what the changes were

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    it is easy to roll back changes and isolate them

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    version controlling my homework, of course!
