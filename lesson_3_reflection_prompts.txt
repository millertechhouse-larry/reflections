When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Collaborating and working on multiple machines.  Also to back data up in case
    my machine dies.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I am in the middle of a change, I don't want to pull automatically.
    I would rather wait until I am done with a commit so I don't have to deal
    with conflicts

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork copies a repository on github to another location on github
    Clone copies a repository to a local machine
    Branch works within a repository to make particular changes to a commit

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I can merge conflicting changes that I have made or at least see what those
    conflicts are

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    email code, use google drive, etc
    merging would be much harder, not making commits would be easier, but I would
    lose the versioning capability

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Separate branches can be reviewed without affecting or breaking master.
    This is good for experimental features or changes that may not be accepted.
